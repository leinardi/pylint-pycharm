# pylint-PyCharm-plugin

This plugin provides on-demand scanning of Python files with Pylint from within PyCharm/IDEA.

Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells 
(as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).
